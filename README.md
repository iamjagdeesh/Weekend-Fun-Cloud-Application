### Abstract:
Imagine making a spontaneous plan for the weekend without going through the pain of searching about the activity and events by yourself which should suit your budget perfectly. Well, our app, WeekendFun does exactly that for you! 

The application(UI) will take as input from users number of people (your friends) in the group, age information, and an approximate budget for the trip. It will then recommend top 5 fun activities to do during weekend within that budget. Fun activity recommended could be any outdoor activity such as hiking, trekking, cycling through the forest etc. Our recommendation engine recommends the activities based on some of the parameters like expected weather on the given day, number of people, age group, availability of tickets etc. Our application can be scaled in/out based on the number of user requests and will be quick in recommending the best possible activities to do for the group. Application will be deployed on Google cloud and will be accessible as a web service.
